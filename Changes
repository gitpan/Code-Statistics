    - some internal restructuring
    - extended capabilities of metrics:
        - they can declare themselves statistically insignificant now to hint
          reporters as to how to handle them
        - they can define a short name for themselves now, for reporters to use
    - support/incompatible logic actually works now
    - added calculation of deviation from the standard for each entry in the
      top/bottom tables
