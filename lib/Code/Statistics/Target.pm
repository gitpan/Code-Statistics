=head1 NAME

Code::Statistics::Target - base class for Code::Statistic targets

=head1 VERSION

version 1.102521

=head2 find_targets
    Returns an arrayref to a list of targets found in the given file.
    Is called with the target class name and a Code::Statistics::File object.
    This function should be overridden with specific logic to actually retrieve
    the target list.

=head2 incompatible_with
    Returns true if the given metric is explicitly not supported by this target.
    Is called with the target class name and a string representing the metric
    identifiers after 'Code::Statistics::Metric::'.
    Default is that all targets are compatible with all metrics.

=head2 force_support
    Returns true if the given metric is forcibly supported by this target.
    Is called with the target class name and a string representing the metric
    identifiers after 'Code::Statistics::Metric::'.
    Default is that no forcing happens.

    Has higher precedence than 'incompatible_with' and should be used to
    override incompatibilities set by other metrics.
