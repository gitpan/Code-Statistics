=head1 NAME

Code::Statistics::Metric::path - measures the starting column of a target

=head1 VERSION

version 1.102520

=head2 incompatible_with
    Returns true if the given target is explicitly not supported by this metric.

    Returns false for this class, since it is never measured and just serves as a placeholder for the path column.

=head2 is_insignificant
    Returns true if the metric is considered statistically insignificant.

    Returns false for this class, since it only identifies the location of a
    target.
